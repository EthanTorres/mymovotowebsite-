      <p>Movoto Real Estate was founded in 2005 on a simple idea: Real Estate should be easy. Since then, we've strived to provide agents and brokers with unmatched technology, lead generation, and marketing support, as well as provide the most comprehensive search and market research technology to home buyers and sellers. Movoto is also expanding our national online real estate brokerage to brick-and-mortar locations in California and Nevada.

As the second-largest, 50-state fully licensed online real estate brokerage in the US, Movoto is one of the most influential online real estate platforms. We’re a technology company bringing real estate into the future by helping over 350,000+ daily visitors find, sell, and research homes and connect to professional agents.

Movoto.com has been selected three years in a row for Inc. Magazine's 500|5000 fastest-growing private companies and #14 by San Jose Business Journal’s Top 51 Fastest Growing Private Companies in Silicon Valley.

We're continuously expanding and testing new products in the market, value teamwork and collaboration, offer an entrepreneurial culture of innovation and excellence, and are committed to fostering an environment rich in opportunity and professional growth.</p>
